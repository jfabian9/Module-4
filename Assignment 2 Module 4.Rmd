## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
x<-read.lp("Assignment3.lp")
```

```{r}
x
```

```{r}
solve(x)
```

```{r}
get.objective(x)
get.variables(x)
```

```{r}
### I tried to run this formula but know its not correct, was just curious
###what I am doing wrong
```

```{r}
library(lpSolve)
obj.fun<-c(420,360,300,420,360,300,420,360,300)
constr<-matrix(c(1,1,1,
       1,1,1,
       1,1,1,
       20,15,12,
       20,15,12,
       20,15,12,
       1,1,1,
       1,1,1,
       1,1,1,
       .0013,-.001,
       .0013,-.002,
       nrow=11,byrow=TRUE))
constr.dir<-c("<=","<=","<=","<=","<=","<=","<=","<=","<=","=","=")
rhs<-c(750,900,450,13000,12000,5000,900,1200,750,0,0)

probsol<-lp("max",obj.fun,constr,constr.dir,rhs,compute.sens = TRUE)
